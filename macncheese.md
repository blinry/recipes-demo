## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).
2. Peel and chop the butternut squash and then add to a bowl with the olive oil and salt and pepper and toss so that all the pieces are lightly coated with the oil.
3. Transfer to a parchment lined baking tray and bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes until soft and cooked.
4. While the butternut is baking, prepare the pasta according to package directions. Once cooked, cover (to stop it from drying out) and set aside.
5. Add the onion and crushed garlic to a pot with the olive oil. Sauté until softened. Leave it in the pot you will come back to it later.
6. Prepare your cashew cheese sauce by adding the cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, salt, water and paprika to a blender jug and blending until smooth.
7. When the butternut squash is cooked, add it to the pot with the onion and garlic and toss together.  Pour over the cashew cheese sauce. Use an immersion blender to blend it up into a smooth sauce. If you don’t have an immersion blender then add to your blender jug in stages until perfectly blended and then return it to the pot.
8. Add the cooked pasta and mix it in with the sauce.
9. Serve with some grated vegan cheese, black pepper, vegan parmesan and fresh cilantro.
